# Image Noise Cancellation Using FFT

A Python implementation of frequency-domain image filtering using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to separate and visualize low-frequency and high-frequency components.

## Features

- 2D Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) for image processing
- Low-pass and high-pass frequency filtering
- Interactive visualization of frequency spectrum
- Clean separation of image components

## Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- OpenCV (`opencv-python`)
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install opencv-python numpy matplotlib
